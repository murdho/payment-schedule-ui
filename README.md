#### Disclaimer: Fake Data

Right now it is using a fake API which means that some of the schedule fields are randomly generated. 

Please **do not use the schedules** for real-life financial situations.

## TODO

- [x] MVP - schedule calculator, fake API usage
- [x] Deployment to GitHub Pages
- [x] Add error boundary and better error handling
- [ ] Add config, refactor locale string usages to use config
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Add a separate products page
- [ ] Build and deploy using GitHub Actions
